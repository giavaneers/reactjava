New ReactJava Project Configuration

1. The Node Package Manager must be installed on your computer. To check if it's already installed, 

> npm -version
6.1.0

If it is installed, the version will be displayed. If not, install it from the node.js webpage:

   https://nodejs.org/en/


2. With npm installed, use it to install browserify from the command line if it has not been installed already:

> npm install -g browserify


3. To configurae a new project, open a terminal window from within IntelliJ and install React:

> npm install react

> npm install react-dom


4. If you want to use components from material-ui in your project, install it from the IntelliJ terminal window:

> npm install @material-ui/core 

> npm install @material-ui/icons


5. If you want to generate iOS or Android apps with your project, install React Native from the IntelliJ terminal window:

> npm install react-native

> npm install --save-dev metro metro-core 


Now your project is configured for development of your ReactJava application.
