## Introduction

[ReactJava](https://reactjava.io) provides the ability to create React web applications using the Java programming language.  In an upcoming release, it will also automatically port any ReactJava web application to iOS and Android for deployment as a native application on mobile devices.

ReactJava is not a framework in its own right; it is simply a lightweight front-end providing access to the standard React framework from Java.

ReactJava was initially created as an educational aid for Advanced Computer Science high school students in which Java is taught as the sole programming language in compliance with the College Board national curriculum. The intention was to allow students fluent in Java but inexperienced in Javascript the ability to leverage all the power of React, lightweight, declarative, performant, component-based programming that is simple to write and easy to debug, packaged in a way that naturally combines the structure, familiarity, and reach of Java.

Despite its initial focus on computer science education, it has emerged as a tool of more general interest in its own right to a broader developer community. Although we make no claims that the developer experience with ReactJava is generally better than that of normal React, some may find it appealing to be able to use Java with its inherent structure, rich set of robust, industrial-strength tools, leveraging the enormous collection of existing Java libraries to build the same great applications for mobile and the desktop that is done normally with React and React Native.

## Getting Started

The [ReactJava Developer Guide](https://reactjava.io/#userGuide) is the central resource for those wishing to learn how to create a React application with Java. The [Getting Started](https://reactjava.io/#getStarted) section will help you get up and running right away with [create-reactjava-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-reactjava-app).
